This project is a sales forecasting web app designed for small businesses. So far, I’ve built and tested the backend pipeline in Python, including automatic data cleaning that detects date and sales columns, and a forecasting engine with model selection between Prophet and recursive linear regression based on data size and seasonality. I’ve implemented logic for low-confidence predictions and created a Streamlit MVP that allows users to upload CSVs, preview cleaned data, and view forecasted results. I’ve also written unit tests for key components. Next, I plan to rebuild the app as a full-stack web application using Flask for the backend and React for the frontend. Features on the roadmap include inventory recommendations, CSV download support, interactive visualizations with Plotly, and production deployment on Render.
