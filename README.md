## üìñ How to Use

### Step 1: Upload Your Data
- Click "Upload a file" or drag and drop your CSV file
- Your CSV should have columns for dates and sales amounts
- We'll automatically detect and clean your data
- **Supported formats**: Date columns (Date, Order Date, Time), Sales columns (Sales, Revenue, Amount, Total)

### Step 2: Review Data Quality
- Check data quality insights and potential issues
- View pattern analysis (weekly trends, seasonal patterns)
- Understand how your data characteristics affect forecasting

### Step 3: Review Your Data
- Check that your data looks correct after cleaning
- Dates are formatted properly
- Sales amounts are numeric

### Step 4: Generate Forecast
- Click "Generate Forecast" to run the AI models
- Choose between automatic model selection or specify a model
- View educational insights about model selection

### Step 5: View Results
- See your sales forecast with confidence intervals
- Blue line = historical data
- Green dashed line = predicted sales
- Shaded area = confidence range
- Export results as CSV for further analysis

## ü§ñ AI Models Explained

### Prophet Model
- **Best for**: Datasets with 30+ data points and seasonal patterns
- **Capabilities**: Handles trends, seasonality, and holidays automatically
- **When used**: Automatically selected for larger datasets or when weekly patterns are detected

### Linear Regression
- **Best for**: Smaller datasets (10-30 data points) without strong seasonal patterns
- **Capabilities**: Uses past 3 days to predict next 7 days
- **When used**: Automatically selected for smaller datasets without clear patterns

### Model Selection Logic
The AI automatically chooses the best model based on:
- **Data size**: More data = Prophet, Less data = Linear Regression
- **Pattern detection**: Weekly patterns trigger Prophet selection
- **Data quality**: Missing data or outliers may affect model choice

## üìä Understanding Your Results

### Confidence Intervals
- **Narrow bands**: High confidence in predictions
- **Wide bands**: Lower confidence, consider collecting more data
- **95% confidence**: Predictions fall within this range 95% of the time

### Data Quality Insights
- **Missing values**: Rows with missing sales data are excluded
- **Outliers**: Unusually high/low values that may affect accuracy
- **Date gaps**: Missing days in your data sequence
- **Volatility**: How much your sales vary day-to-day

### Pattern Analysis
- **Weekly patterns**: Sales higher/lower on certain days of the week
- **Trends**: Overall direction of sales (increasing/decreasing)
- **Seasonality**: Repeating patterns over time

## üìÅ Sample Data

Try the application with the included sample data:
- `data/preprocesstester.csv` - 45 days of realistic e-commerce data
- `data/sample_sales.csv` - 30 days of sample sales data

## üîß Technical Details
